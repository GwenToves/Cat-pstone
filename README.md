#### Predicting Wool-Sucking Behavior in Cats

If you don't know what wool-sucking is and you have 30 seconds available, please go watch a clip on YouTube. Unless you hate cats, then just take a gander at a me implementing skills in data manipulation, cleaning, visualization. I then use a supervised machine learning model to predict wool-sucking behavior in a binary capacity. 

I used [this dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Salonen_et_al_Breed_differences_of_heritable_behaviour_traits_in_cats_-_data/8143835/1) from Salonen et al. on Breed differences of heritable behaviour traits in cats.
