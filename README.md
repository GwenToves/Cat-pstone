# Cat-pstone
Capstone 2 for Springboard Data Science Career Track (About Cats)

This will be my baby for the next few weeks. I plan to create a model that can predict wool-sucking behavior in cats. If you don't know what wool-sucking is and you have 30 seconds available, please go watch a clip on YouTube. Unless you hate cats (what did they ever do to you?), I assure you it will be worth your time.
